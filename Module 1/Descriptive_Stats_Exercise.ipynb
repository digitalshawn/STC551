The data comes from a [project on Github](https://github.com/lmeninato/GoFundMe/) which collected information about GoFundMe projects in 2018.\n",

I've stubbed out a series of steps below. I will describe each task and leave an open code block for you to complete the task. Please use text blocks to summarize your analysis. Use your own knowledge and the [Module 1 example descriptive stats notebook](https://github.com/digitalshawn/STC551/blob/main/Module%201/Descriptive%20Stats%20Example.ipynb) as a guide, but you may use other techniques to answer the prompts.\n",
